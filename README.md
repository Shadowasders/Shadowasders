- 👋 Hey, my name is Aubrey McKinney. I'm a former Musical Theatre artist from Philadelphia! I've always loved computers, from building them, gaming on them, to just messing around in the settings and seeing what I could break! Before the pandemic a friend introduced me to code, and I fell in love. Code is a challenge unlike anything I've done before. From being on stage singing and dancing, to using my mind to find clever ways to solve problems, and make websites funcitonal & beautiful! It's nice to meet you, take a look around my work, and enjoy!

- 👀 I’m currently enrolled in the EDx bootcamp through the University of Pennsylvania!  
- 🌱 I'm nearing the end of my course, working through back-end technology like Mongodb, React, and MySQL. I'm looking forward to finishing the course and being let loose on the world!
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on anything! I have a passion for the front-end in particular, but am open to gaining experience in any way I can!
